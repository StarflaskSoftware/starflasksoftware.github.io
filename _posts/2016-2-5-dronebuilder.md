Trying to learn how to build a drone?  Just trying to pick the right parts out?  Maybe you are a pro and you want to share your build or your knowledge with others.  Check out [DroneBuilder.io](http://dronebuilder.io).

![Sample Calc]({{ site.url }}/assets/samplecalc.png)


Here is an example of the results from a build calculation.  Parts can be selected from dropdown menus or they can be added with custom properties: mass, current rating, KV, and more.  Battery life, propeller thrust, and part-compatibility warnings appear with a single mouse-click.  Builds can be saved and shared with the community and then filtered or searched by parts.   

For those new or scared of building drones, a micro-blogging platform also lives on Dronebuilder.io called the Learning Hub.  Anyone can publish articles to this hub with guides for anything related to multicopters.
